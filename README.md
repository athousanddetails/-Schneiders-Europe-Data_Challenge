Solution Proposal for EcoForecast: Revolutionizing Green Energy Surplus Prediction in Europe

‚û°Ô∏è Context:
With increasing digitalisation and the ever-growing reliance on data servers, the significance of sustainable computing is on the rise. Schneider Electric, a pioneer in digital transformation and energy management, brings you this innovative challenge to play your part in reducing the carbon footprint of the computing industry.

The task is simple, yet the implications are profound. With aim to predict which European country will have the highest surplus of green energy in the next hour. This information will be critical in making important decisions, such as optimizing computing tasks to use green energy effectively and, consequently, reducing CO2 emissions.

üéØ Objective:
The goal is to create a model capable of predicting the country (from a list of nine) that will have the most surplus of green energy in the next hour. For this task, we need to consider both the energy generation from renewable sources (wind, solar, geothermic, etc.), and the load (energy consumption). The surplus of green energy is considered to be the difference between the generated green energy and the consumed energy.

The countries to focus on are: Spain, UK, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Hungary, Italy, Poland, and the Netherlands.

The solution must not only align with Schneider Electric's ethos but also go beyond its current offerings, presenting an unprecedented approach.
